This repo contains the Terraform plans for HyperFlex with Cisco DCNM Managed VXLAN Projects. For each project, a sub-directory is created with all the Terraform plans, a README file that outlines what was implemented in the Terraform plans, and a link to the CVD or whitepaper for details on the solution.
